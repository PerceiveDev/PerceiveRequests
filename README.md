# Before Requesting a Plugin
Before you request a plugin from us, there are a few things you should know:
- We build our plugins with Java 8
- We do not support Minecraft versions earlier than 1.9
- A lot of our plugins rely on our core library, [PerceiveCore](https://www.github.com/PerceiveDev/PerceiveCore/)
